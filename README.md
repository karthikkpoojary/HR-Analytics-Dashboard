## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project showcases an end-to-end **HR Analytics dashboard** that helps HR teams and senior management track employee demographics, attrition patterns, job satisfaction, and performance trends.

The dashboard is designed to:  
- Identify attrition hotspots across age, department, and job roles.
- Understand key factors driving employee turnover and satisfaction.
- Support data-driven HR decisions for retention, hiring, and engagement.


## 🎯 Business Problem  

HR teams in large organizations struggle with:  
- High and unexplained employee attrition.
- Limited visibility into how demographics, compensation, and satisfaction affect turnover.
- Difficulty in identifying at-risk groups and designing targeted retention strategies.

This project addresses these challenges through an interactive dashboard that converts raw HR data into actionable insights.


## 🧠 Key Questions Answered  

The dashboard is built to answer critical HR questions such as:  
- Which **age groups** and **departments** have the highest attrition?
- How do **job role, salary slab, and business travel** relate to employee churn?
- Are employees with lower **job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, or work–life balance** more likely to leave?
- How do **total working years, years at company, and years with current manager** impact retention?


## 📊 KPIs & Metrics  

Key metrics visualized in the Power BI dashboard include:  
- **Attrition metrics**: Attrition count, attrition rate, attrition by age group, department, and job role.
- **Workforce structure**: Employee count by gender, education field, marital status, and salary slab.
- **Engagement & satisfaction**: Environment satisfaction, job involvement, job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and work–life balance levels.
- **Career & tenure**: Total working years, years at company, years in current role, years since last promotion, and years with current manager.


## 🗂️ Dataset Description  

The dashboard is powered by a single structured Excel file:  

- **HR_Analytics.xlsx** – Contains employee-level HR data with fields such as:
  - EmpID, Age, AgeGroup, Gender, MaritalStatus.
  - Department, JobRole, JobLevel, BusinessTravel.
  - MonthlyIncome, SalarySlab, PercentSalaryHike, StockOptionLevel.
  - Attrition flag, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance.
  - TotalWorkingYears, YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager.

This structure mimics a real-world HR data model for employee analytics and attrition studies.


## 🏗️ Project Structure  

```bash
HR-Analytics-Dashboard/
  HR_Analytics.xlsx        # HR data source
  HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix  # Power BI report file
  README.md
```

- The **Excel file** serves as the core data source.
- The **Power BI file** contains all data transformations, relationships, and visualizations.


## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Pages  

The Power BI report can be organized into intuitive, business-focused views such as:  

1. **Executive Summary** 🧭  
   - Overall employee count, attrition count, attrition rate.
   - High-level breakdown by department, age group, and gender.

2. **Attrition Analysis** 📉  
   - Attrition by age group, job role, department, and salary slab.
   - Filters for business travel, education field, and marital status to explore drivers of churn.

3. **Engagement & Satisfaction** 🙂  
   - Distribution of environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, job involvement, and relationship satisfaction.
   - Comparison of these scores between employees who stayed vs those who left.

4. **Tenure & Career Path** 🧭  
   - Patterns across total working years, years at company, and years since last promotion.
   - Identification of high-attrition segments by tenure and job level.


## 🔍 Key Insights (Examples)  

From a typical HR analytics perspective, this type of dashboard can reveal insights such as:  
- Higher attrition among **younger age groups** and **entry-level roles** compared to senior levels.
- Increased churn in roles with **frequent travel** or lower satisfaction scores.
- Certain departments showing **consistently higher attrition**, indicating potential culture, workload, or leadership issues.

*(These are representative insights that this dashboard is designed to surface once connected to organizational data.)*  


## ✅ Business Recommendations  

Based on the insights such dashboards enable, HR teams can:  
- Design **targeted retention programs** for high-risk age groups, departments, and roles.
- Improve **work–life balance and satisfaction** for segments with low engagement scores and high attrition.
- Revisit **compensation and promotion policies** for employees with long tenure but stagnant growth.
- Continuously **monitor attrition KPIs** to evaluate the impact of HR interventions over time.


## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated  

This project highlights:  
- **HR Analytics & Attrition Analysis** using real-like employee data.
- **Power BI** for modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboard design.
- **Data storytelling** for HR and business stakeholders through visuals and KPIs.


## 📄 Notes  

- The provided **HR_Analytics.xlsx** dataset is structured for learning and portfolio purposes; it can be replaced with real organizational data.
- Visual themes, colors, and layout in the Power BI file can be customized as per your branding or presentation needs.
